# simple_shell
My attempt at a shell program...
Starting by following along with a [tutorial](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/)
## Steps
- [ ] Load config file
- [ ] Create shell instance
    - [ ] Process commands 
        - [x] read input, parse arguments
        - [ ] create actual commands
    - [ ] Terminate on signal
## Problems 
- programLoop() should print "->" then read input/parse args and that should be the iteration, currently only prints "->" once.
